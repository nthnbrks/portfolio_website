                Joy Wang is the college-aged, queer daughter of Evelyn and Waymond Wang. 
                Joy Wang is also Jobu Tupaki, the interdimensional entity and main 
                antagonist of “Everything, Everywhere, All at Once,” and her psychological 
                arc is one of vast importance to modern society, no matter how seemingly 
                unreachable her predicament within the film may be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jobu Tupaki is Joy Wang, but a version of Joy Wang from a different universe. 
                Jobu is from a universe known in the film as the “Alphaverse”, as it is the 
                first universe to develop the technology to travel between different 
                universes. In the Alphaverse, she was extensively experimented on in what 
                would amount to torture in order to study the effects of repeated 
                “verse-jumping” on the human mind. Instead of the death that was expected of 
                her, Jobu’s mind “broke,” and her consciousness became scattered throughout 
                every universe. As a result of this, she was able to inhabit every version 
                of herself, in every universe, amounting to an infinite amount of experiences 
                at any given moment in time. In this, Jobu Tupaki became a part of Joy Wang, 
                just as she became a part of all infinitely-many versions of herself. She 
                drifted through endless worlds in which every possible combination of 
                existences dwelled, living through everything, always. Her choices no longer 
                mattered, for every choice had already been made. No decision yielded any 
                significance, as there were always infinitely more universes to inhabit in 
                which every other possible decision was made. There was no more reason to 
                continue. Everything had already been done. Everything had already been seen. 
                The vastness of every possible universe had been unraveled in front of her, 
                and in being given everything, she had nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story of Jobu mirrors the beliefs developed by 
                <a href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2017/05/23/the-most-depressing-book-ever-written-death-by-starvation-by-hegesias-of-kyrene/">Hegesias</a> 
                of Cyrene, or the 
                philosophy of existential nihilism. Like many philosophers of his day, Hegesias 
                believed that the central purpose of life was to seek pleasure, however, he 
                came to his own conclusion that true pleasure simply did not exist. He 
                believed that it was impossible to be completely happy, and that nothing in 
                existence is objectively pleasant or good. With this he deemed all action as 
                indifferent, as none can be expected to yield any happiness in return, and all 
                life as ultimately no more desirable than death. He is known to this day as 
                Hegesias the Death Persuader, as his philosophical writings were seen as so 
                inescapably depressing that many who read his works were said to have committed 
                suicide as a direct result. His most famous book, “Death by Starvation,” was 
                not only banned from being taught, but resulted in Hegesias himself being banned 
                from teaching in many places just for having written it. The book has been lost 
                to time, as have many of his teachings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jobu Tupaki is one of the most fulfilling representations of a modern existential 
                nihilist. As a result of her undeniably existential predicament, there was no more 
                happiness to be had, no more pleasure to seek, as every action held no longer any 
                novelty, but was just a “statistical inevitability.” She saw death, as did Hegesias, 
                as an equal if not preferable alternative to life, and for this, she planned to 
                destroy herself. She constructed what amounted to a black hole, in the form of an 
                everything bagel that truly had everything on it. “All of my hopes and dreams. 
                My old report cards. Every breed of dog.” Her plan was simple: Allow herself to be 
                sucked into the bagel. End everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the film, Evelyn is recruited to help stop Jobu, and she decides to do so by 
                subjecting herself to the same experimentation that created Jobu, under the 
                pretense that if she could somehow become like Jobu, she could stop her. However, 
                when her own mind “breaks,” she quickly falls down the same path as her daughter. 
                It is only through the power of her husband, Waymond, who, while unaware of the 
                magnitude of the conflict at play, faces existential nihilism head-on.
            </p>
            <p>
                The philosophical conclusions created through existential nihilism are indisputable. 
                That is why they can seem so overwhelming at times. There is no logical answer to 
                the idea that life has no meaning. It is an unfalsifiable stance. The only way to 
                move forward is to accept this. To live meaningfully in a meaningless life is, by 
                definition, absurd. There lies a discrepancy between the understanding that there 
                is no value to life and the ability of oneself to live it as if every moment is 
                infinitely valuable, and that is, by definition, absurd. To somehow bridge that gap, 
                and live comfortably in such a state of existence, is by definition, absurd.
            </p>
            <p>
                Absurdism is a philosophical belief system first developed by 
                <a href="https://www.philosophytalk.org/blog/camus-and-absurdity">Albert Camus</a>. The 
                belief is outlined by the fundamental acceptance of the meaningless of reality, 
                and the conscious decision to rebel against that fact, by living enthusiastically 
                in spite of it. As 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv79l1b-eoI">Alexander McKechnie</a> put it, absurdism is to “party at the end 
                of meaning”. It is accepting that life is absolutely, positively, absurd, and that 
                any attempts to live meaningfully are ridiculous, but to accept that one has to be 
                ridiculous to live at all, and so to be as ridiculous as possible. To accept the 
                meaninglessness of life is to grant oneself infinite freedom, to allow oneself to 
                live life to the fullest in spite of all that may come. To look into the abyss with 
                a smile. To be absurd is to want, to hope, to dream, despite knowing what lies at 
                the end of every journey. To be absurd is to fight against all external factors, 
                by simply continuing to live.

                Near the end of the film, Waymond, in a universe in which Evelyn left him, never 
                moved with him to America, and never raised a child with him, tells her, “When 
                I choose to see the good side of things, I’m not being naive. It is strategic and 
                necessary. It’s how I’ve learned to survive through everything. This is how I 
                fight.” And in this, Evelyn learned the truth, a truth that leads to the resolution 
                of the film as a whole. That our choices may not matter, that we may never know why 
                we’re here, that the universe is strange, and harsh, and uncaring, but that we 
                should only live more intensely because of it. That we should fight everyday by 
                seeing the good side of everything, and enjoying life in spite of it all. That 
                everyone we love may just be a random assortment of atoms, but that we’ll love 
                them even harder anyways. That is to be absurd.
