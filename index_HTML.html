        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Howdy and welcome to my website! I'm Nathan, a computer science student
            and quantitative finance master's candidate at Texas A&M. I have a lot
            of disparate passions, and I hope that this website can serve as a way
            to categorize and display those passions and a little bit about what
            I've done to further myself over these past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can find links to connect with me further, my short list of computer
            science-related projects, my much longer list of written works, some skills
            and qualifications of mine, my one meaningful service project, and a little
            bit of extra fun for those with the time to be nosy and browse around.
        </p>
        <p>
            So please, dear viewer, explore and allow yourself to understand me, as I put
            myself here to be examined by those beyond my knowledge or control. Feel free
            to send me an email or linkedin message to explain to me how and why my website
            sucks and how I may go about fixing/improving it. Have fun! Love you.
        </p>
