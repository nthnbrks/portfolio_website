                In 1721, an edition of the 
                <a href="https://idiomation.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/jack-of-all-trades/">Boston News-Letter</a> 
                included the phrase, “Jack of all trades and it would seem, good at none.” 
                This is known today as the first recorded instance of this phrase in any American 
                publication. Through centuries of slight modifications, it has transformed into 
                the now widely known figure of speech, “A Jack of all trades is a master of none.” 
                Despite the popularity of this quote in this particular phrasing, this is merely 
                an American adaptation of an even older saying. The original quote from Geffray 
                Mynshul’s 1618 book “Essays and Characters of a Prison” is both analogous to the 
                modern version and simultaneously completely opposite in meaning. “Jack of all 
                trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than a master of one.” The 
                modern interpretation of the quote is understood as taking a disapproving stance 
                on the acquisition of skill in multiple disciplines, with the implication that 
                such an endeavor leads to a lack of true depth in any of the fields explored. The 
                original quote was intended to mean quite the opposite, that the journey to skill 
                in many activities of knowledge in many disciplines is oftentimes more rewarding 
                and notable than the search for mastery in one specific field. 
            </p>
            <p>       
                The ideas explored through the original quote can be accurately articulated through 
                the study of polymathy, originally defined by Johann Von Wowern in his book 
                “<a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QWVA4EYdY6cC/page/n5/mode/2up">De Polymathia Tractacio</a>” 
                as “knowledge of various matters, drawn from all kinds of studies.” The general 
                understanding of a Polymath today is a person who excels in multiple areas of study 
                as opposed to just one, a generalist as opposed to a specialist. The psychological 
                justification for such a goal comes from the following ideas: that the value of knowledge 
                in the process of learning itself is often more beneficial than the actual knowledge 
                gained on a discrete subject through the learning process. While sustained effort on 
                one pursuit may yield better results in the short term, efforts in a wide variety of 
                pursuits benefit broadening the mind and yield overall greater knowledge in the long 
                term. Furthermore, that width of knowledge is often better suited to problem-solving 
                and creative thinking than depth of knowledge. A turn to history can help to exemplify 
                these concepts.

                The most famous polymath to ever live is 
                <a href="https://www.leonardodavinci.net/">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. Da Vinci is credited 
                with both the most famous painting of all time (the “Mona Lisa”) and the most expensive 
                painting to ever sell at public auction (the “Salvator Mundi”), but his fame extends 
                far beyond that of the art world. He produced the first ever form of technical drawing, 
                with over 5,000 pages filled with detailed representations of countless inventions and 
                mechanical designs, many of which were conceived and can be accredited in part or in 
                whole to him during and beyond his lifetime. Some of da Vinci’s additional 
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci">accomplishments</a> 
                include the role of senior military architect and general engineer 
                in the papal army, vast research into anatomy and physiology, advancements in early 
                cartography, plans for a canal in Florence that were carried out to his exact 
                specifications centuries later, and many more. In the centuries of writings on da 
                Vinci and his works to follow, the most succinct summary of his proficiencies has 
                been to label him as a great thinker. The core skill, the talent at the root of all 
                of his accomplishments, was his ability to think. In his journey to study all that 
                the world had to offer, the variety and breadth of his learning built a foundation 
                that would support his future studies. His skill in painting was fundamental in his 
                ability to document and express the human body. His understanding of the human body 
                was fundamental to his understanding of the complex machines he would come to design. 
                His understanding of these machines, their parts and proportions, and the thought 
                process of designing them proved fundamental to the effort and design process of his 
                painting. He could only achieve greatness in a given field through his work in 
                seemingly disconnected areas of study, as all are connected by thinking, learning, 
                and developing.

                It is these processes that underlie all that there is for man to accomplish. To 
                learn, think, and develop are not only skills in their own right but serve as the 
                building blocks for what the concept of skill even is. More and more, Western 
                society has become geared towards specialization, and early specialization at that. 
                Students are expected to decide career paths that will impact the rest of their 
                professional lives while they are still children, with indecision or a change of 
                plans hindering their success. Even by 
                <a href="https://www.tedxmanchester.com/speakers-2020/david-epstein/">delaying</a> 
                the process of specialization a few years and giving students more time to explore 
                and learn new subjects, growth factors within and enjoyment of career paths 
                increase drastically. This demonstrates that time spent engaging in hobbies, 
                side-projects, and fields of personal interest is never time lost. All learning, 
                growth, and thinking in any discipline is valuable to all other disciplines, 
                sometimes even more so than that discipline may be to itself.

                In Malcolm Gladwell’s book “Outliers: The Story of Success,” he defines the 
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662388/">10,000-hour rule</a>. 
                This rule states that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to gain true expertise in 
                any given skill. While this rule can serve as a cool fact, it is time to ditch it 
                as a goal to strive towards. Let there instead be a new 10,000-hour rule, one that 
                does not stress spending 10,000 hours on one subject but rather 1,000 hours on ten 
                different subjects. Spend 500 hours on 20 different subjects. Spend 100 hours on 
                100 subjects. Learn a new instrument. Learn two new instruments. Start playing a 
                new sport. Figure out how to use a new piece of software. Find some new books to 
                read. Pick up interior decorating. Pick up sewing. Start writing. Learn how to solve 
                a Rubik’s cube. Learn how to juggle. This rule may not lead to “true expertise” on 
                any of the activities pursued, but maybe, just maybe, something entirely different 
                could be achieved in the process. Maybe, through this rule, one could learn how to 
                learn, how to think, and how to improve. Maybe one could learn something that no 
                discipline in itself could teach, but something that is only possible through a 
                combination of everything else. And that might be the key to true expertise itself.
