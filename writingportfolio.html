            <h3>My Writing</h3>
            <p>
                I’m currently an editor at 
                <a href="https://www.thealinemag.com/">The A-Line Magazine</a>. 
                This is my first semester as editor, as I spent my last 3 as a staff
                writer for the organization. I had no writing experience before this outside
                of school assignments. I believe the process of learning to write for an
                audience for the purpose of entertainment to have
                been an incredibly valuable source of development for me, both emotionally
                and professionally. I have had to expose my creativity, passions, technical skill
                and knowledge, public speaking ability, and time management skills to many 
                people both directly and indirectly. I have been able to push my own boundaries
                and limits to write about a wide variety of topics in a wide variety of styles.
                A-Line has been the most rewarding part of my college experience, and I cannot
                wait to see how my time here continues.

                Every semester, A-Line produces and sells a high quality 
                print magazine issue. Here are the articles I’ve written 
                for this format.

                        <p>
                            My first print article. This was such a joy to produce 
                            and really threw me through the ropes of creating 
                            written work of a quality worth paying for.
